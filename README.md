# Arduino Motion Detection System

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino Uno and a PIR motion sensor to detect movement and also displays the last detected motion time on a 16×2 I²C LCD.

## Acknowledgements
The original PIR motion detection example was inspired by a tutorial from Circuit Magic on YouTube:

This project extends the original example through the integration of the following:
- Buzzer (auditory indicator)
- LCD 
- User-configurable time input
- Motion timestamp display

## Purpose 
The circuit serves as a simple security system, detecting motion and alarming users through both visual and sound indicators. It also utilizes a user-based time reference to display the time of the most recent detected motion on an LCD. 

## Features
- PIR motion detection
- LCD display
- User-entered reference time
- Calculates motion detection time using `millis()`
- LED indicator
- Buzzer

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR501 PIR sensor
- 5V Buzzer
- LED
- 16×2 I²C LCD
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## How it works
1. Arduino calibrates the PIR sensor.
2. User enters the current time.
3. The system tracks elapsed time using `millis()`.
4. When motion is detected, the LCD shows the calculated detection time, and simultaneously, the LED and buzzer go off.

## How to Use
1. After circuit construction, upload the sketch to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
2. Wait about 30 seconds for the PIR sensor to calibrate.
3. Open Tools → Serial Monitor.
4. Enter the current time in the format `HH MM SS` (e.g., `14 30 00`) and press *Send*.
5. Once the time has been entered, the system will begin monitoring for motion. And your job is done!
   
## Notes
- The circuit diagram uses a piezo buzzer symbol because Tinkercad does not have a dedicated 5 V active buzzer component.
